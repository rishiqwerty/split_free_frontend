**Split Free** is a web application designed to simplify expense sharing among groups. Whether you're splitting bills with roommates, planning a trip with friends, or managing shared expenses, Split Free helps you track and settle balances effortlessly.

🌐 Live Demo: [split-free-frontend.vercel.app](https://split-free-frontend.vercel.app)  

⚠️ Note:
The initial load of the app might take around 40–50 seconds since the backend server is hosted on Render’s free tier, which can cause it to spin down when idle.
